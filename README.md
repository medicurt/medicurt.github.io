Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! 
I hope you'll enjoy what you find here.
I'm going to keep the original github content below, as I find it useful.

## Part Two: The artifact
This artifact represents the cumulative effort applied over the course of the CS-499 class. The project hosted on the branch final-version includes all three improvements to algorithms and data structures, software engineering and design, and database usage. The final version of the project exists on the 'final-version' branch.
