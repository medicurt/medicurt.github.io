Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! 
I hope you'll enjoy what you find here.

# My ePortfolio: Events API

## Part one: The Code Review
This video was too large to upload directly to github, and had to be hosted on YouTube. This is the code review of the original MongoDB project.

## Part Two: The artifact
This artifact represents the cumulative effort applied over the course of the CS-499 class. The project hosted on the branch final-version includes all three improvements to algorithms and data structures, software engineering and design, and database usage. The final version of the project exists on the 'final-version' branch.

### What to expect:
This artifact is a demonstration of a postgres-python-fastapi backend which uses sqlalchemy for interacting with the database and pydantic for enforcing schemas. There are several tables which exist in this API for hosting and joining events, along with logic for interacting with the database. There are also several API endpoints active, namely the login and user validation as well as the endpoints for CRUDing events. Following the instructions, the code should be able to run on a local machine using a postgres backend, but I've also attached a video to demonstrate functionality in case it does not work.

## Part Three: 
The artifacts for each of the three stages of developing this artifact are hosted on this page, however I've provided a combined narrative on how this artifact satisfies all three artifact requirements for the course and satisfies the course objectives in doing so. It can be found [here](https://github.com/medicurt/medicurt.github.io/blob/main/Combined%20Report.docx) 

## Part Four:
A professional self-assessment is presented to reflect on my journey of developing this artifact and completing the SNHU computer science program.
